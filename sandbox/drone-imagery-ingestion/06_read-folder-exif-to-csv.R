# Purpose: Read in the sorted, uncleaned drone images in mission folders and extract all the EXIF
# data, to compile into the dataset metadata. Save to a file for further processing in next script.
# In constrast to the previous EXIF read script in this workflow, this script reads the full EXIF
# data and it operates on the sorted (not unsorted) imagery folder.
